# movie-ticket-booking-system
This is one of the projects I worked on in my undergraduate years at MIT, Manipal.
This project is a simulation of how a movie ticket booking process takes place in applications such as BookMyShow.
Kindly refer to the project report pdf in the repository for a full understanding of the project's functionality and dependencies. 

This application was made using Visual Studio 2012-2022 and SQLPlus.

NOTE : This is not a fully functioning application and is intended for presentation and demonstration purposes only.
